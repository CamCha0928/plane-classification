# plane-classification
*** 


## Description
*** 
The goal of our project and the application we have implemented is to classify aircrafts with a neural network model.

Thus, in the context of a course on Big Data, our professor and I created an application that performs this classification.

## Notebook
*** 
In this folder we have made available the notebook on which our model is based.

## App
*** 
This folder contains the application and a parameter file app.yaml read at the start of the application containing the following information: 
path to the model, resize of the images and the target variable.
In addition, we have also integrated the labels of the planes of the different target variables.

## Model
***
This file contains our models on the target variables Manufacturer and Family in case "releases".
